# Hangman
Programmed a simple hangman game whereby one player randomly chooses a word from a list of words and the other player gasses the word letter by letter. 
The player gets 5 lives. Each time a player guesses a non alpha character or more than one charachter, it doesn't count against them but each time 
a wrong single alpha charachter is guessed, the lives is reduced and a limp of a man is drawn. Once all limps of the man is drawn, you have lost the game!!


# Technologies
I used Python 3.10 and imported the random module. The game can be implemented by running the hangman.hangman_solution.py in your terminal.
