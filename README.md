# Hangman
Programmed a simple hangman game whereby one player randomly chooses a word from a list of words and the other player gasses the word letter by letter. 
The player gets 5 lives. Each time a player guesses a non alpha character or more than one charachter, it doesn't count against them but each time 
a wrong single alpha charachter is guessed, the lives is reduced and a limb of a man is drawn. Once all limbs of the man is drawn, you have lost the game!!


# Technologies required
Python 3.10 
import the random module. 

The game can be executed by running the hangman.hangman_solution.py in your terminal.
